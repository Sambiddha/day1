### Arithmetic Operators

# Addition
a = 1
b = 2
print(a+b) # here + is an addition operator


# Subraction
a = 5
b = 2
print(b - a)   # here - is an subtractiob operator

# Multiplication
print(a * b)   # * operator is used for multiplication


# Division
print(a / b)   # / operator is used for division

# Exponent
print(a ** 2)  # ** operator is used for exponential document

 ptint(a % 2 ) #here % is an  operator










 # Relational Operators
 a = 1
 b = 1
 print( a==b) # '==' is a comparison operator to check whether the values are equal or not. here it gives true


 a = 5print(a > b) =















#Logical operations
# And
print(True and True) #True
print(True and False) #False
print(False and TRUE ) #False


#OR
print(True OR True)  #True
print(False or True) #True
print( True or False) #True
print(False or False) #false

#not
print(not True) #False
print(not False) #true




## identity operators
# is and is not are the identity check operators
a = 1
b = 1
# Here a and b both refers to the same object with value 1
print(a is b ) # so it returns true


b = 123
print (a is b )# it returns false because b is another object

#with value 123
print (a is not b) # it gives true

## membership operator
ages = (21 )









## Assignment operators
 a = 1 #"=" is the simplest assignment operator which assigns value from the RHS to the variable in LHS

 a = a + 1 #this increases the value of a by 1
 #but this logic can also be written as following
 a += 1 # here += is an assignment operator

 a -= 1 # here -= is an assignment operator




 ## precedance and associativity
 # Precedance is the rule that determines the priority os operators in an operation

 # Associativity is the rule that determines the priority  of operators as if one or more operators have the same precedance

 #Normal Associativity is from left to right. But for ** operator it is right-left

 print(2**3**2) # 3**2 is evaluated first and the result is raised power to 2
